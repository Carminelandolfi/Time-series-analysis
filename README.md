The project consist of an analysis of historical series.
In particular, information regarding a company is considered, namely: revenue, quantity sold, average cost and number of employees.
The main objective is to identify the main characteristics of the series in order to understand which is the best model to make predictions on the revenue variable.
In addition, a number of plausible scenarios will also be established to understand how revenue based on such scenarios and thus allow the company to take the best choice in the shortest possible time.

In this repository, I have uploaded different folders. The 'dataset' folder contains the dataset that I used for the analysis, the 'script' folder contains the R script that I wrote, and finally, I have uploaded an HTML file, which is the file I used to present this work.
