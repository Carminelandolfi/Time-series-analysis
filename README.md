The project consists of an analysis of historical time series. Specifically, information regarding a company is considered, including: revenue, quantity sold, average cost, and number of employees. The main objective is to identify the key characteristics of the series in order to determine the best model for predicting revenue. Additionally, several plausible scenarios will be established to understand how revenue would behave under those scenarios, enabling the company to make the best decisions in the shortest possible time.
